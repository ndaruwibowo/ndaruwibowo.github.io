# Translator Helper Privacy Policy

I, M. Ndaru Wibowo, take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, I provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.


## Collection of Information

This app tracks basic information about its users. This information includes, but is not limited to, typing error details and application usage. None of this information can personally identify specific users of this app. The information is tracked for informational purposes, and none of this information is sent to an outside server. It is solely for your information shown in its About window.
Any information that will be collected is through your consent, i.e. you click the New Entries tray menu or press the keyboard shortcut to open the New Entries submission window, or when you click the Send Feedback tray menu. You must not use this menu if you do not consent to sending your information.

## Links to Third Party Websites

I have included some links on this app for your use and reference. I am not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites that I do not own. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these websites may differ from my own.


## Security

The security of your personal information is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.


## Changes To This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1st, 2024, and will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page.

I reserve the right to update or change my Privacy Policy at any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically. If I make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, I will notify you either through the email address you have provided me, or by placing a prominent notice on my app.
