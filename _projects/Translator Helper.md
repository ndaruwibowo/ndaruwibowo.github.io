Translator Helper is an application that runs in the background (immediately minimized after running) to help ease some of the translator's work, especially typos.
The premise is simple, typos are not good, and fixing typos while working is annoying, so there should be an application to prevent typos from happening, in the first place.
Then, I developed this simple application in late 2022 until now and named it Translator Helper to show that this is my passion project for the world of translation.
I love translation and language intrigue. Hope you like it as much as I do.

# What can it do for you
---
- **Autocorrect** your typos and bad words from its built-in bespoke database.
  Currently, 900+ words will  most likely cover your Translation Typing Words needs (for EN-ID language pair at least) and it will continue to grow.
  For example, replacing _anda to Anda_ is automatically replaced as soon as you type space.

- **KeyRepeater** will allow you to not do repetitive tasks, such as confirming each and every segment in some CAT tools that do not support multisegment confirmation.

- **Offline access** for glossary databases.
  Sometimes you have connection problems, be it slow internet speed or the server you're trying to reach is unresponsive.
  With its built-in offline glossaries from popular websites, you can confidently search and find terms as your heart desires.

- **Be discreet** for your work that uses MT help (**Magic phrase required**).
  Machine Translation, albeit a double-edged sword, undoubtedly helps many translators to achieve their needs.
  However, some translation companies still punish them for using it even though they themselves lower their translation rate.
  So, why don't we try to leverage MT and edit it to the equivalent of that said rate?
  Thus, this feature is developed to be discrete (mask) the origin of your work (only in Trados Studio for now).
